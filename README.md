EvoEngine - new professional 3D/2D game engine development by
WetGrape. 

Purposes:
* Ð¡reating a fully open and modular real-time game engine, with the ability to easily modify it, counting mods
* Providing a simple code interface for creating games and regular software
* Providing real-time team development tools
* Simplify the creation of 3D / 2D interaction interfaces, using a simple API and SDK that will be able to interact with all internal and external modifications

The project is completely free and distributed under the MIT license. The source code of the project can be changed by everyone, and some enthusiasts can send us modified versions of the engine so that we can add them to the main branch and build.
